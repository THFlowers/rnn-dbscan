Note 1)

t7.10k was not available in either main dataset repository.

I lifted it from https://github.com/deric/clustering-benchmark/blob/master/src/main/resources/datasets/artificial/cluto-t7-10k.arff

Originally from "Chameleon: Hierarchical clustering using dynamic moderling." Computer 32.8 (1999): 68-75

Previously from "CLUTO A Clustering Toolkit"

More details in "cluto-t7-10k.arff"


Note 2)

The Grid Dataset was made for the original paper, but is cited as coming from the Finland databse.
